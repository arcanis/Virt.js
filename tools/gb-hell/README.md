# gb-hell

## Description

Compiles a *hell.gb* file (GameBoy ROM) based on a template. This ROM test a large panel of instructions, and plays nicely with the [cpu-diff](https://github.com/arcanis/Virt.js/tree/master/tools/cpu-diff) utility. Actually, it doesn't print anything on screen, so you pretty much have to use it with a diff tool.
